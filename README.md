# Logistic-Regression
We will build a “mini Siri”, which will be capable of extracting flight information search terms from natural language using a logistic regression model.

We will implement a multinomial logistic regression model as the core of natural language processing
system.
Our goal in this assignment is to implement a working Natural Language Processing (NLP) system, i.e., a
mini Siri, using multinomial logistic regression. We will then use the algorithm to extract flight information
from natural text. We will do some very basic feature engineering, though which we will be able to improve
the learner’s performance on this task. We will write one program: tagger.py.
